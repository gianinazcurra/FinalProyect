Hi and thank you for stopping by.
This is our first project as students, and represents an ecommerce focused in bringing together medium-small wine producers and consumers.
We used Java for the back-end, Spring boot framework, and of course HTML, CSS and JS on the front-end.
The project is based on three types of users: Clients, Wine producers and Web administrators.
Every user has a profile page where they can access information, add products, see purchases, modify data, ect.
To register as a client you must be +18.
Only client users can purchase products. 
The purchase must be approved by administrators.
Session times out after a time of inactivity. 
When you login you'll be reminded of any pending purchase you may have still not completed. You can cancel the purchase or proceed to checkout.
While a purchase is ongoing, stock of selected products will be blocked until the purchase is completed, canceled or not approved by administrators.
A second login will logout the previous one.
More features to be added soon.
